# backpack-amazon-1M-search-engine

part 2 of the recruitment project

## Getting Started


### Questions

* How long is takes to get all the data for 1M products? Can you make it faster? How?
  * For my case, I could scrape 130+ data in one hour.
* For each field, what % of the items are missing that field? Any idea why and how to minimize?
* Approximately, how much will it cost every time youâ€™ll refresh your inventory? How to bring that down?
* How to scale this to 10M items? Or 100M?
